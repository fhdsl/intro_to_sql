# Intro to SQL {.unnumbered}

## Course Description

Data that we need to utilize and query is often stored in data sources such as databases or data warehouses. In this course, you will learn how to connect and query databases using Structured Query Language (SQL). In particular, we will focus on querying data in a commonly used data model for storing patient data called OMOP. By the end of this course, you will be prepared to construct complex queries to retrieve large data sets and automate these queries to produce automated reports and dashboards.

## Learning Objectives

- **Explain** data sources such as Databases and how to connect to them
- **Query** data sources using database engines and Structured Query Language (SQL) to **filter**, **join**, and **aggregate** data
- **Construct** and **calculate** new fields using `SELECT` or `CASE WHEN`
- **Read** and **explain** a sample OMOP query: https://github.com/OHDSI/OMOP-Queries/tree/master
