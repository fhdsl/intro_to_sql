# Intro to SQL {.unnumbered}

## Course Description

Data that we need to utilize and query is often stored in data sources such as databases or data warehouses. In this course, you will learn how to connect and query databases using Structured Query Language (SQL). In particular, we will focus on querying data in a commonly used data model for storing patient data called OMOP. By the end of this course, you will be prepared to construct complex queries to retrieve large data sets and automate these queries to produce automated reports and dashboards.

## Learning Objectives

- **Explain** data sources such as Databases and how to connect to them
- **Query** data sources using database engines and Structured Query Language (SQL) to **filter**, **join**, and **aggregate** data
- **Construct** and **calculate** new fields using `SELECT` or `CASE WHEN`
-  (optional) **Read** and **explain** a sample OMOP query: <https://github.com/OHDSI/OMOP-Queries/tree/master>

## Tentative Schedule

All classes are on Fridays from 12:00-1:30 PM PST. Connection details will be provided. Office hours related to each class day are posted below, and the invite will be sent to you. 

In class we will be going through the Quarto Notebooks that are hosted on Posit.cloud. No knowledge of R is necessary, we'll show you what you need to know in class.

Classes will be recorded, and those recordings will be sent to you after each class.

## Format of Class

I will teach online only, though you have the option of attending in the DaSL Lounge (Arnold M1-B406), which will have snacks and drinks available. Either Chris Lo or Vivek Sriram will host in person.

We will spend the first 20-25 minutes of each class on catching up on last week's exercises if you haven't had the opportunity to work on them. Followed by that, we will have a short lecture/lab, where we will go through the notebooks for the week. 

## First Class Survey

[First Class Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQnKvZuj_7LVd-Nqm3TQIoJ3hGPPq2WSUmgUltkvPvirCrTQ/viewform?usp=dialog) - Please fill out. We mostly want to see how confident you are before and after class. We will share these results with everyone (anonymized).

## Weekly Check In

[Weekly Check In Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx2WevmnwP1S2d9zhO_joHjdVbMkylVvEPjhd1WxLIbUaf8w/viewform?usp=sharing) - please fill out to let us know if you have any issues or want to share what you've learned. We look at the answers in aggregate and we anonymize responses (unless you want us to know).

## Culture of the course

-   Learning on the job is challenging
    -   I will move at learner's pace; we are learning together.
    -   Teach not for mastery, but teach for empowerment to learn effectively.
    
We sometimes struggle with our data science in isolation, unaware that someone two doors down from us has gone through the same struggle.

  -   *We learn and work better with our peers.*
  -   *Know that if you have a question, other people will have it.*
  -   *Asking questions is our way of taking care of others.*

We ask you to follow [Participation Guidelines](https://hutchdatascience.org/communitystudios/guidelines/) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fhdsl/coc).

## Posit Cloud Project

For those who are not Fred Hutch learners and want to try the course out, we have an Posit.cloud Project that you can clone to your own account: <https://posit.cloud/content/10022544>
