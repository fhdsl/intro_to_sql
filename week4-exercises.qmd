We'll first connect to the database:

```{r}
#| context: setup
library(duckdb)
library(DBI)
library(DiagrammeR)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), 
                      "data/GiBleed_5.3_1.1.duckdb")
                      
```

## Subquery in `SELECT`

Fill in the blank in the query below to find each patient's demographic data along with the **total number of procedures** they have had.

```{sql connection="con"}
SELECT 
  person_id,
  gender_source_value,
  race_source_value,
  (SELECT 
      COUNT(*) 
    FROM 
      procedure_occurrence 
    WHERE 
      person.person_id = procedure_occurrence.person_id
  ) AS number_of_procedures
FROM 
  person;
```

2. Fill in the blank in the query below to dynamically calculate the **number of months** between the **procedure start date** and today for all procedures from the `procedure_occurrence` table

```{sql connection="con"}
#| eval: false
SELECT 
  person_id,
  visit_occurrence_id,
  procedure_occurrence_id,
  procedure_concept_id, 
  procedure_datetime,
  (SELECT 
    DATE_DIFF(
      'month', procedure_datetime, DATE '2025-03-07'
    )
  ) AS procedure_time_to_tody
FROM 
  procedure_occurrence;
```



## Subquery in `WHERE`

Count the number of cases for `procedure_occurrence` with the following criteria:

```{sql connection="con"}
SELECT 
  person_id, 
  birth_datetime, 
  gender_source_value, 
  race_source_value, 
  ethnicity_source_value
FROM 
  person
WHERE 
  person_id IN (
    SELECT 
      person_id 
    FROM 
      condition_occurrence
    WHERE 
      condition_concept_id == '40481087'
  );
    
```


## Creating a view (with `DATEDIFF`)

Create a view for senior citizen occurrences, where we collect procedure occurrences for all patients aged >= 50 at the time of their procedure

```{sql}
#| connection: "con"
CREATE VIEW senior_procedures AS
SELECT * 
FROM procedure_occurrence 
WHERE procedure_occurrence.person_id IN (
  SELECT 
    person_id 
  FROM 
    person 
  WHERE 
    DATE_DIFF(
      'year', 
      person.birth_datetime, 
      procedure_occurrence.procedure_datetime
    ) >= 50
);
```
