In this class, our main way of interacting with databases is SQL (Structured Query Language).\n\nAn execution engine - a software system that queries the data in storage. There are many examples of this: SQL Server, MariaDB, DuckDB, Snowflake. These can live on our machine, on a server within our network, or a server on the cloud.\n\nData Storage - the physical location where the data is stored.

Because of restrictions on clinical data, sometimes the only way to analyze it is on an approved laptop. DuckDB does wondrous things on laptops, so we hope it will be a helpful tool in your arsenal.\nIt is what is called an analytical database engine, which means it is very fast for reading and querying data. This is compared to a transactional database engine, which must handle multiple users interacting and inserting data into the database at once.\n\n\nBut you can think of other configurations that might be more applicable to you. For example, a lot of groups at the Hutch use SQL Server:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\nA[\"1.SQL\"] --&gt; B\nB[\"2.SQL Server\"] --&gt; C\nC[\"3.FH Shared Storage\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, SQL Server and its storage are tightly coupled (the engine and the storage are in the same location). This coupling can make it difficult to migrate out of such systems.\nOr, for those who want to use cloud-based systems, we can have this configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\nA[\"1.SQL/Notebooks\"] --&gt; B\nB[\"2.Databricks/Snowflake\"] --&gt; C\nC[\"3.Amazon S3\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we need to sign into the Databricks system, which is a set of systems that lives in the cloud. We actually will use SQL within their notebooks to write our queries. Databricks will then use the Snowflake engine to query the data that is stored in cloud storage (an S3 bucket).\nIf this is making you dizzy, don’t worry too much about it. Just know that we can switch out the different layers based on our needs.",

    "text": "1.4 What is SQL?\nSQL is short for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized language for querying databases (originally relational databases)\nSQL lets us do various operations on data. It contains various clauses which let us manipulate data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\nClause\nPurpose\n\n\n\n1\nFROM\nChoose tables to query and specify how to JOIN them together\n\n\n2\nWHERE\nFilter tables based on criteria\n\n\n3\nGROUP BY\nAggregates the Data\n\n\n4\nHAVING\nFilters Aggregated Data\n\n\n5\nSELECT\nSelects columns in table and calculate new columns\n\n\n6\nORDER BY\nSorts by a database field\n\n\n7\nLIMIT\nLimits the number of records returned\n\n\n\nWe do not use all of these clauses when we write a SQL Query. We only use the ones we need to get the data we need out.\nOftentimes, we really only want a summary out of the database. We would probably use the following clauses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\nClause\nPurpose\n\n\n\n1\nFROM\nChoose tables to query and specify how to JOIN them together\n\n\n2\nWHERE\nFilter tables based on criteria\n\n\n3\nGROUP BY\nAggregates the Data\n\n\n5\nSELECT\nSelects columns in table and calculate new columns\n\n\n\nNotice that there is a Priority column in these tables. This is important, because parts of queries are evaluated in this order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDialects of SQL\n\n\n\nYou may have heard that the SQL used in SQL Server is different than other databases. In truth, there are multiple dialects of SQL, based on the engine.\nHowever, we’re focusing on the 95% of SQL that is common to all systems. Most of the time, the SQL we’re showing you in this course will get you to where you want to go.",

In this case, each row in the table above corresponds to a single person.\n\nDatabase Field - the columns in this table. In our case, each column corresponds to a single measurement, such as birth_datetime. Each column has a specific datatype, which may be integers, decimals, dates, a short text field, or longer text fields. Think of them like the different pieces of information requested in a form.\n\nIt is faster and requires less memory if we do not use a single large table, but decompose the data up into multiple tables. These tables are stored in a number of different formats:\n\nComma Separated Value (CSV)\nA Single File (SQL Server)\na virtual file\n\n\nIn a virtual file, the data acts like it is stored in a single file, but is actually many different files underneath that can be on your machine, on the network, or on the cloud. The virtual file lets us interact with this large mass of data as if it is a single file.\nThe database engine is responsible for scanning the data, either row by row, or column by column. The engines are made to be very fast in this scanning to return relevant records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRows versus Columns\n\n\n\nJust a quick note about row-based storage vs column-based storage. SQL was originally written for relational databases, which are stored by row.\nA new trick is column-based storage. It turns out that it’s actually faster to query the data in many instances when the data in a column is all stored together. These are the formats like Parquet that you might have heard about. A lot of newer database engines rely on the data to be stored in this format.",

This way, we can protect our password from prying eyes and bots.\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ(scope=\"user\")\n\n☐ Edit '/Users/tladera2/.Renviron'.\n\n\n☐ Restart R for changes to take effect.\n\n\nAdd the following to your .Renviron file:\nCLASS_DB_PASSWORD=\"IntroSQL\"\nYou may have to reopen the project for it to be loaded in your environment variables.

    "text": "3.2 Subqueries\nA subquery is a query nested inside another query. Subqueries let us process smaller computations inside larger outer queries.\nThe following is a great example from The Data School, offering a visualization of how a subquery works. In this case, we use a subquery to calculate the total number of friends across individuals by state. Here, we are making use of a subquery in our SELECT clause. Let’s dive a little deeper into this type of example using our own data.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example: Using a Subquery in the SELECT Clause\nLet’s use a subquery to dynamically calculate the age of each individual (as of March 7th, 2024) in our database while collecting other patient metadata. To handle this, we’ll make use of the person table in our dataframe and the birth_datetime column.\n\nSELECT \n  person_id, \n  birth_datetime,\n  gender_source_value, \n  race_source_value, \n  ethnicity_source_value,\n  (SELECT \n    DATE_DIFF('year', birth_datetime, DATE '2024-03-07')\n  ) AS age\nFROM \n  person;\n\nAs we can see in the above example, we’ve performed the computation of calculating patient age in a subquery:\nSELECT \n    DATE_DIFF('year', birth_datetime, DATE '2024-03-07')\nThis subquery is integrated into the larger query of collecting patient data.\n\n3.2.2 Check on learning\nFill in the blanks here to complete the query that dynamically calculates the timespan (in days) between the start and end date for conditions from the condition_occurrence table\n\nSELECT \n  person_id,\n  visit_occurrence_id,\n  condition_occurrence_id,\n  condition_concept_id, \n  condition_start_date,\n  condition_end_date,\n  (SELECT \n    DATE_DIFF(\n      'day', condition_start_date, condition_end_date\n    )\n  ) AS condition_time_span\nFROM \n  condition_occurrence;\n\n\n3.2.3 Example: Filtering with a Subquery\nWe’ve now worked through a couple of examples where we use subqueries to create new variables within our SELECT clause. Another thing we can try to do is filter our data based on conditions calculated in a subquery.\nHere’s another great example from The Data School, where we apply a subquery in the filtration component of our larger query to find individuals on Facebook who have the same number of Facebook connections as anyone else on LinkedIn.\n\nFor our own database, let’s collect patient demographic data for all patients who had some kind of procedure performed after January 1st, 2019. We’ll make use of the person and procedure_occurrence tables for this query.\n\nSELECT \n  person_id, \n  birth_datetime, \n  gender_source_value, \n  race_source_value, \n  ethnicity_source_value\nFROM \n  person\nWHERE \n  person_id IN (\n    SELECT \n      person_id \n    FROM \n      procedure_occurrence\n    WHERE \n      procedure_datetime &gt;= DATE '2019-01-01'\n  );\n\n\n3.2.4 Check on learning\nFill in the blanks here to complete the query that selects patients who had conditions starting after January 1st, 2019.\n\nSELECT \n  person_id, \n  birth_datetime, \n  gender_source_value, \n  race_source_value, \n  ethnicity_source_value\nFROM \n  person\nWHERE \n  person_id IN (\n    SELECT \n      person_id \n    FROM \n      condition_occurrence\n    WHERE \n      condition_start_date &gt;= DATE '2019-01-01'\n  );",

    "text": "3.3 Views\nA view is a stored SQL query that acts as a virtual table. Views improve code reuse and readability. The following image, taken from SQLShack, depicts how a complicated query can produce a new customized view that can be used in downstream data processing.\n\n\n3.3.1 Example: Creating a View\nWith our own data, let’s create a view from the concept table that focuses on the drugs in our dataset.\n\nCREATE VIEW drugs AS\nSELECT * FROM concept\nWHERE domain_id == 'Drug';\n\nNow, we can use this view just like a table:\n\nSELECT * FROM drugs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf a view already exists in your database, then trying to create a new view with the same name will generate an error! To delete a view from memory, using the DROP VIEW command. E.g.:\nDROP VIEW IF EXISTS drugs;\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Check on learning\nFill in the blanks to create a view that stores measurements from the concept table\n\nCREATE VIEW measurements AS\nSELECT * FROM concept\nWHERE domain_id == 'Measurement';\n\n\nSELECT * FROM measurements;",

One of the ones you might have had to struggle wiht is JAVA_HOME, whih is where you set a Java installation.\nWe can set environment variables directly, or we can specify them in a file called .Renviron that lives in our home directory.\nWe will use them as a more secure way to store our passwords. We choose the user scope so that it is saved in our home directory, not the project directory. This way, we can protect our password from prying eyes and bots.\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ(scope=\"user\")\n\n☐ Edit '/Users/vsriram/.Renviron'.\n\n\n☐ Restart R for changes to take effect.\n\n\nAdd the following to your .Renviron file:\nCLASS_DB_PASSWORD=\"IntroSQL\"\nYou may have to reopen the project for it to be loaded in your environment variables. We can now load the password using Sys.getenv().\n\nSys.getenv(\"CLASS_DB_PASSWORD\")\n\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nYou can also set the environment variable using Windows Control Panel or PowerShell: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable - the easiest way to do it is probably the control panel method.\nThere will probably be some sort of authentication process involved in connecting to your databases at Fred Hutch. I’ll add more info when I know more.\nThere is much more about storing passwords and other secrets such as API keys here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/secrets.html.",
